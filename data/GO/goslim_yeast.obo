Also, note that cytokinesis does not necessarily result in physical separation and detachment of the two daughter cells from each other.

comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. This term does not provide specificity with respect to the type of protein binding, e.g. transcription factor binding or RNA polymerase binding. Please use a child term that provides that specificity or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

def: "A growth pattern exhibited by budding haploid cells under certain growth conditions, in which cells retain the typical axial budding pattern of haploids, but become elongated and fail to separate after division; during growth on a solid substrate, this results in penetration of cells into the agar medium. An example of this process is found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae." [GOC:mcc, PMID:9728395]
comment: Note that this term should not be used to describe the invasion of host tissues by pathogenic organisms, which is described by the biological process term 'entry into host ; GO:0044409', nor should it be used to describe growth of diseased cells of an organism into the surrounding normal tissue, which is outside of the scope of GO.

Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

comment: Note that 'tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity ; GO:0009022', also known as 'ribonuclease PH', does not have parentage in the 'nuclease activity' branch of the ontology because both GO and the Enzyme Commission define nuclease activity as a type of hydrolysis.

def: "Stimulates the exchange of guanyl nucleotides associated with a GTPase. Under normal cellular physiological conditions, the concentration of GTP is higher than that of GDP, favoring the replacement of GDP by GTP in association with the GTPase." [GOC:kd, GOC:mah]
comment: Note that guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity alters binding affinity, but not GTPase catalytic activity directly. Therefore GO:0005085 is under 'regulation of GTPase activity' but is not a 'GTPase regulator', which is reserved for cases where the action of one gene product directly alters the rate of catalysis by another gene product.

def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

DNA replication begins when specific sequences, known as origins of replication, are recognized and bound by initiation proteins, and ends when the original DNA molecule has been completely duplicated and the copies topologically separated. The unit of replication usually corresponds to the genome of the cell, an organelle, or a virus. The template for replication can either be an existing DNA molecule or RNA." [GOC:mah]

A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway."

Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

def: "The process in which a solute is transported from one side of a membrane to the other." [GOC:dph, GOC:jid]
comment: Transmembrane transport requires transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.
