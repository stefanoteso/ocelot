Ocelot
======

Ocelot is a collection of Python utility classes and methods for processing
biological data and building predictors, with a focus on protein function and
interactions.

It provides some Python infrastructure to:

- Convert data from a handful of databases into RDF format.
- Build prediction datasets from the RDF data by querying a local SPARQL endpoint.
- Compute biologically meaningful features and kernels, expoiting information
  from protein/domain/residue sequence, homology, structure, co-expression
  and other kinds of annotations.
- Run prediction experiments.
